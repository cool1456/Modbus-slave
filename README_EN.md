# Modbus-slave
This is a modification from [foxclever](https://github.com/foxclever/Modbus) .On this basisï¼Œi deleted some unnecessary files that were not useful to me and i add code of error handling . Now, the protocol stack includes Modbus-RTU and Modbus-TCP protocols.It is very convenient to transplant to many different devices such as STM32,AVR,GD32 etc.
